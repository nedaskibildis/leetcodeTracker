This project allows users to enter anybody's LeetCode Username, and have that users statistics displayed to them in a visually appealing manner. This project was created to help teach myself how to use fetch API's and Axios, As I used fetch api calls from my frontend to back end, and used a combination of Axios and Cheerio to scrape the leetcode website. This Project also was used to help me gain a base understanding of React, as it uses React Components, React State, And React Effect.
